### Hello

You've reached the source code for my personal website. The markdown for each blog post can be found at `site/post/`. 

To build a development version of this site, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` (if you have Yarn installed) from the base directory.

To build a production version of the site, run `npm run site:dev` or `yarn site:build`.
