### Hello

You've reached the source code for my personal website. The markdown for each blog post can be found at `docs/post/`. 

To build a development version of this site, run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` (if you have Yarn installed) from the base directory.

To build a production version of the site, run `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To update the default theme, run `sudo yarn global add vuepress`, then `vuepress eject site/`.

Verify the vuepress version with `vuepress -V`.
