I'm a software engineer at Abbvie Stemcentrx. In my spare time, I like to think about stupid ideas with intention.

### About this site

I created this website with [VuePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress), and forked my [own version](https://github.com/lbertge/lbertge2.github.io/tree/master/.vuepress/theme) of the default theme. You can find all the source code (including the text written for each page) [here](https://github.com/lbertge/lbertge2.github.io).
