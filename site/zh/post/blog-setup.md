# Blog setup

[[toc]]

Shit, this website way took too long and unequivocally frustrating to set-up. But as with any experience, I think the process has taught me a lot about what I expect of myself when writing down my thoughts and how to present them. 

As of this post's inception, I plan to write chronologically, because I think it best explains how I arrived at the current state of the blog. I may change this, depending on how concisely I can write about my experiences.

## Hugo

Among other reasons to start writing, I looked up to my friend [Justin's blog](https://www.jkleong.com) as reference point. Justin had originally used Jekyll to help scaffold his website, then switched over to Hugo. He seemed pretty happy with it, noting a speedup in site building. So I too looked into Hugo. However, I have dignity and didn't want my website to appear an exact copy, so I set off looking for a theme I liked. 

Amusingly, that logic extended into theming that well. There were themes that stood out to me, but I remained mostly unhappy that I wasn't able to get the theme to show _exactly_ as I liked. I didn't know CSS very well - enough to poke around and figure out gets toggled, but not enough to feel confident about refactoring entire layouts. So I was hung up on the details, and never really focused on the content itself.

Another important bit is that I wanted the flexibility to include JS in my posts. Around the time I started this endeavor I was learning about [VueJS](https://www.vuejs.org). I wanted to take advantage of a modern JS ecosystem such as Vue, with its component-focused design, in combination with Webpack, single-file components. So naturally I hated the idea of including dirty `<script>` tags, importing Vue libaries from CDNs, and the like in my pretty Markdown file.

In retrospect I think Hugo still would have suited most of my blogging needs.
